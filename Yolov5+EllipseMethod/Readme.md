This method uses a YOLOv5 object detector and finds the iris in an image.
The bounding box's center is then found and drawn. (later this will you Ellipse fitting for more accurate center point)
Run implement.py to run a test infrence from it. (this will use test.mp4 which you can replace with your own videos)
